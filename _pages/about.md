About Me
=====
I'm a computer scientists interested in processor simulation and design.

I'm pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science at Georgetown University, and I received my B.S. in Computer Science/Math from Pepperdine Univeristy.

Current Interests
=====
I'm actively pursuing multiple projects in processor design and verification.
The [Pep9Milli](https://github.com/Matthew-McRaven/pep9milli) attempts to use symbolic verification to prove the correctness of the Pep/9 processor.
This project detected multiple errors in existing processor microcode.

[Pep10](https://github.com/StanWarford/pep10suite) is an architectural refresh of Pep/9, introducing a new macro-assembly language.
It changes the 

Pep9Si is a combined hardware design/verification project aiming to bring Pep/9 to a FPGA.
Progress is documented by multiple posts to this site.
