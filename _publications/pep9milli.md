This paper introduces a process for using open-source software verification tools to verify the correctness of CISC microprocessors. The three-part process introduces a new language (millicode) at a higher level than microcode. Millicode is compiled to a high-level language (i.e., C) as well as microcode. Software verification tools verify that the high- level language representation meets the processors’s RTL. The process is demonstrated by verifying an existing CISC processor, Pep/9. A partial millicode implementation of Pep/9’s RTL is created and verified using Klee.
